It has been a while since I've written code in Java, so I wanted to refresh my memory by joining the [VCT Hackathon](https://vcthackathon.devpost.com/).

# Tech 

Currently there is no much here yet. I wanted to test out some new things or refresh my memory on some old things.

- Gradle
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JDBC
- Spring Batch (maybe)
- DuckDB ‚ùå

I tried to integrate DuckDB, but for some reason it did not want to cooperate with Spring Data JDBC. For the record, this is what I tried:

- I implemented a custom Dialect, which was just an extention of the `PostgresDialect`
- This seemed to mostly work, but for some reason the DuckDB driver was complaining that prepared statements were not supported.

Anyway, you may be wondering why I didn't import the JSON directly into DuckDB. I tried that, but the resulting structure is so clunky, I
think the resulting SQL would be an unreadable and unmaintainable nightmare.

# Goal

Just to get me going, I decided on this first use case:

Extract a list of all matches played and the composition of the teams (the roles).
This is going to be the input for a chatbot that will decide the best team composition.
